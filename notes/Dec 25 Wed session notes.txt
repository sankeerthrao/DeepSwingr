DeepSwingr End-to-End Run Session - December 25, 2024 (Wednesday)
=================================================================

## Summary
Successfully cloned, explored, trained, built, and ran the DeepSwingr 
cricket ball swing simulation framework end-to-end.

## What Was Done

### 1. Repository Setup
- Cloned https://github.com/gpavanb1/DeepSwingr
- Created Python virtual environment (.venv)
- Installed all dependencies (tesseract-core, jax, flax, equinox, diffrax, etc.)

### 2. Codebase Exploration
Explored and explained the full architecture:
- main.py: Interactive CLI for trajectory/optimization
- tesseracts/: 5 containerized physics modules
  - simplephysics: Empirical physics with neural network
  - jaxphysics: JAX-CFD based Navier-Stokes solver
  - integrator: Diffrax ODE solver for trajectory
  - swing: Swing calculation module
  - optimiser: Brent's method optimization
- plotter/: 3D Plotly visualization
- helper/docker.py: Container orchestration

### 3. Training
Ran trainall.sh to train neural network physics proxies:
- jaxphysics: Best val loss = 0.002965 (100 epochs)
- simplephysics: Best val loss = 0.000905 (100 epochs)
Weights saved to tesseracts/*/weights/*.msgpack

### 4. Docker Build
Built all 5 tesseracts as Docker containers:
- integrator:latest
- jaxphysics:latest
- simplephysics:latest
- swing:latest
- optimiser:latest

### 5. Simulation Results

**simplephysics backend** (empirical model):
- Velocity: 35 m/s (126 km/h)
- Lateral swing: 1.24 cm (30° seam angle)
- Optimal seam angle: 55.8° for 5.32 cm max swing

**jaxphysics backend** (CFD-based):
- Lateral swing: 12.73 cm (30° seam angle) 
- Optimal seam angle: -66.1° for 15.55 cm max swing
- 10x more swing due to realistic fluid dynamics

### 6. Generated Files
- trajectory_output.html: 3D Plotly visualization (simplephysics)
- trajectory_jax.html: 3D Plotly visualization (jaxphysics)
- demo_run.py: Demo script for simplephysics
- demo_jax.py: Demo script for jaxphysics

## Files Modified
- tesseracts/jaxphysics/weights/jaxphysics_weights.msgpack (re-trained)
- tesseracts/simplephysics/weights/simplephysics_weights.msgpack (re-trained)

## Next Steps
- View the HTML trajectory files in browser for interactive 3D visualization
- Run `python main.py` for interactive CLI mode
- Try different velocity/roughness/seam angle combinations
- Consider pushing the commit to origin

## Git Commit
Commit f3b111a: "Run end-to-end training and simulation demo"
